<b>A URL shortener</b> service creates a short url/aliases/tiny url against a long url.Moreover, when user click on the tiny url, he gets redirected to original url.<br>
I created the URL Shortner React Application using shrtco API, so we just need to fetch data from the api and add long url as a parameter and then we get the shortener url. I also tried to implement copy to clipboard functionality with react-copy-to-clipboard package.


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
